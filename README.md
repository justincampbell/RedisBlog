# A blog built using Redis and CodeIgniter

Copy the application/ directory into an existing CodeIgniter project.

## Dependencies and Thanks
- Redis http://github.com/antirez/redis

- PHP Markdown Extra* http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/
- PHP SmartyPants Typographer* http://michelf.com/projects/php-smartypants/
*Not REALLY needed. You could just go through the code and remove those parts, but your 
blog will be a tiny bit uglier.
